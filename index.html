            <p>Niagra Falls is a very breathtaking place, the large waterfalls produce a lot of steam, which very frequently also pruduces rainbows.</p>

            <p>Mexico is another place to travel to as there are a lot of sight seeing places and the resorts can be really nice. Some of the sightsyou can see are the Mayan temples, large caves, and much more.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Dominacan Republic</h2>
            <img src="image/image3.png" alt="Error" class="dr-img">
            <p>Dominacan Republic has a lot of nice resorts, and in my opinion the La Romana resort is one of the best in the Domincan Republic. There are no washed up seaweed on the beach, and you can swim a bit offshore to something that looks like an artificial reef and there are many fish there.</p>
